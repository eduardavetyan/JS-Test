# JS Test

Create an Event Calendar with JQuery or AngularJS

#### Functionality we must implement

- Calendar must have possibility to switch between years and months
- It must have weekdays at the top of the days
- Take attention on February 29th for every year selected
- The weekends (saturday, sunday) must be red colored
- We must have functionality to add an Event (id, title, description) to particular day
- We must have ability to update or delete an Event
- Notification must be triggered, a day before the event will start
- It will be good to have ability to drag and drop the Event from one day to another
- Will be good to have bulk creation of Events (same event for multiple days)

Don't focus on CSS deeply. It can have poor design.<br>

Do as much as you can and send us the code in archive (.zip) or in GIT for review.
